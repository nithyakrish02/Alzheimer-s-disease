            <p style="text-align: left,;">Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder that affects millions of people around the world. It is the most common cause of dementia, which is a group of symptoms that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, which lead to the death of brain cells and the eventual loss of cognitive function.

              Alzheimer's disease is a significant and growing public health concern, especially as the world's population ages. According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 6 million Americans currently live with Alzheimer's disease, and this number is expected to triple by 2050. The disease not only has a significant impact on individuals and families but also on healthcare systems and society as a whole.
