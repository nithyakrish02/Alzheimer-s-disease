    <p>
      Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder that affects millions of people around the world. It is the most common cause of dementia, which is a group of symptoms that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, which lead to the death of brain cells and the eventual loss of cognitive function.

Alzheimer's disease is a significant and growing public health concern, especially as the world's population ages. According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 6 million Americans currently live with Alzheimer's disease, and this number is expected to triple by 2050. The disease not only has a significant impact on individuals and families but also on healthcare systems and society as a whole.

    <p>
      To overcome the above problem we are building a model which is used for the prevention
      and early detection of Alzheimer disease. Basically, Alzheimer disease diagnosis depends
      on the different MRI scan images. Here the person can upload
      the images of MRI scan  and then the image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the
      image and detect whether the person is having alzheimer or not. The trained  model detects
      the disease with accuracy. To overcome this problem, we are building the model that detects the disease with high
       accuracy. Our model classifies <br> types  of Alzheimer disease such as Demented and Nondemented.
